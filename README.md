# Masters-Thesis
Formulating the problem of data partitioning in a reinforcement learning framework. A working environment suitable for applying DRL agents, with options tailored towards improving its efficiency, such as file and runtime caching

This environment can be executed directly in Colab (in future hopefully I will provide how we can pip install this environment and can adapt it as any other gym environment).

---

There are two files:
```
environment_class.py -> The environment class
queries.py -> All the TPC-H queries
```

## TODO
* [ ] Provide documentation of how this environment work 
* [ ] How it can be used with DRL agents from frameworks for example ACME (pip install and in colab)
